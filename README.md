# GitHub Pages with Docker support
This is a GitHub Pages Starter that supports the use of Docker on your local computer. 

Changes to any files will instantly be reflected on the local website http://127.0.0.1:4000/ when served with Docker, making the development of your own website very convenient.

## Prerequisites
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## GitHub Setup
1. Create your GitHub repository
     - Follow steps 1-3 on [Creating a repository for your site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-a-repository-for-your-site)
     - The following are optional and depends on your preference:
         - Repository's visibility (**Public** / **Private**)
         - README.md
         - .gitignore
         - licence
2. Modify GitHub repository settings
     - Follow the steps 1-8 under [Publishing from a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch)
3. That's it! You're done with the GitHub configurations! :partying_face:

2. Get a copy of the source code [v0.1.0](https://github.com/yurebecca/jekyll-github-pages-with-docker/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
3. Copy all the files from step 2 to the location of step 1
4. Run the following command: `docker compose up -d`
5. In your Docker Desktop, you should see the newly created container
6. Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:4000

8. Voila! That's it~

Use the following commands
1. ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```
2. ```

   ```
3. Navigate to your GitHub repository online
